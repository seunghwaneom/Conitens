## Coding Standards

### Python (scripts/)

```python
# Follow PEP 8
# Use type hints where practical
def cmd_new(args: argparse.Namespace) -> None:
    """Create a new task.
    
    Args:
        args: Parsed command-line arguments
    """
    pass

# Docstrings for all public functions
# Error handling with informative messages
```

### JavaScript (bin/)

```javascript
// Use const/let, no var
// Shell-free execution (Node.js DEP0190 compliance)
// Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/macOS/Linux)
```

### Markdown (docs/)

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Include code examples with language hints
- Keep lines under 100 characters
